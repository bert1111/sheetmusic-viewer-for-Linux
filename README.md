Sheetmusic viewer for Linux

This software uses kivy, .....

I am building this because I couldn't find suiteable software to run on my postmarketOs device.
This is completely built with Perplexity and at the moment it is still being developed.

Currently you can load a PDF, rotate and scale it per page, but annotations aren't persistent yet.
Music Libraries to organise on orchestra and concerts are also not developed yet.

If anyone can help with this please do so, because I am not a programmer.
